A simple GUI which extracts relevant information from a Purchase Order and exports it as an excel sheet

This is just in the first phase and can only read the the sample PDF I gave, this is just to test the code and is not meant for widespread use.

BEFORE YOU RUN THE CODE - In the dialog box where you have to enter something, simply enter "Company A" or "A" (not case sensitive) as the company's name in this case is "Company A".

The code is only meant to extract the stuff given in the form of a list at the bottom of the PDF and turn it into an excel sheet for ease of use.
